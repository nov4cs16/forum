    | Here you may configure all of the mailers used by your application plus

    | you and you are free to add your own as your application requires.
    |
    | Laravel supports a variety of mail "transport" drivers that can be used
    | when delivering an email. You may specify which one you're using for
    | your mailers below. You may also add additional mailers if needed.
    |
    | Supported: "smtp", "sendmail", "mailgun", "ses", "ses-v2",
    |            "postmark", "resend", "log", "array",
    |            "failover", "roundrobin"
